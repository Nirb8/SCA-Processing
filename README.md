# SCA-Processing
A Processing 3 implementation of the Stranded Cellular Automaton, with optional time varying and space varying rulesets.

Processing 3 is needed to run the program, you can get it here at https://processing.org/download/

Click the cells in the bottom row to flip through the initial cell states, spacebar to generate new rows of cells, and r to reset the automata. 

For ruleset input, click the cells on the sample grid to the left to toggle their states, m to swap between editing turning and crossing rules, and l to load the ruleset currently displayed in the sample grid into the bottom row of cells.
